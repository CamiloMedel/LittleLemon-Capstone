# Project Background
The Little Lemon Restaurant was in need for a new website with a table reservation system. The previous website had users confused about how to use it. Also, customers were previously unhappy with how the Little Lemon webpage looked and functioned. A way for customers to book a table with a chosen date and time was needed in a new and improved website.

# Design Process
<ins>**Empathizing:**</ins><br/>
I created a user persona in order to help me understand the user's needs and frustrations.

<ins>**Defining the problem:**</ins>
<br/>
After getting to understand and empathize with the users of the Little Lemon webpage better, I created the following problem statement:
<br/>
<br/>
**"Customers are unsure of how to book a table with our current reservation system due to the layout and functioning of the reservation webpage."**
<br/>
<br/>
<ins>**Low Fidelity Wireframe**</ins>
<br/>
The next step was to create a low fidelity wireframe of the website within Figma. The web layout of the homepage was created using a layout design provided by Meta.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<ins>**High Fidelity Prototype**</ins>
<br/>
I then created a high fidelity prototype built off my low fidelity wireframe. Using a brand style guide, I added color and fonts that resonate with the Little Lemon brand. I made some changes to the original layout design provided by Meta in order to improve the webpage look and feel. Most importantly I created high fidelity wireframes for the table reservation system which includes custom Figma components and interactivity to make the prototype reflect a final interactive experience. Now my design and reservation experience could be tested within Figma.

# The Final Build
The final build followed the high fidelity prototype. In order to better meet the project scope, the amount of pages in the reservation system were reduced. This reduction also helped condense and only require the form inputs neccessary.
