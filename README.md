# Project Background
The Little Lemon Restaurant was in need for a new website with a table reservation system. The previous website had users confused about how to use it. Also, customers were previously unhappy with how the Little Lemon webpage looked and functioned. A way for customers to book a table with a chosen date and time was needed in a new and improved website.

# Design Process
**Empathizing:**<br/>
I created a user persona in order to help me understand the user's needs and frustrations.

<br/>

**Defining the problem:** <br/>
After getting to understand and empathize with the users of the Little Lemon webpage better, I created the following problem statement.<br/>
<br/>
"Customers are unsure of how to book a table with our current reservation system due to the layout and functioning of the reservation webpage."

**Wireframing and Prototyping**
